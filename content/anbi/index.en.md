A Stichting is the Dutch equivalent of a foundation obliged to have a deed drawn up by a notary (also referred to as the articles of association). Stichting Sol Nascente was established on January 8, 2019 in Voorschoten, the Netherlands. After this deed has been drawn up, establishing the social objective, the foundation was registered with the Chamber of Commerce (‘[Kamer van Koophandel](https://www.kvk.nl/)’).

This information was drawn up to satisfy the legal requirement to obtain the status of a public benefit organization (in Dutch: [Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/bijzondere_regelingen/goede_doelen/algemeen_nut_beogende_instellingen/wat_is_een_anbi), or henceforth: ANBI).

##### Mission
Sol Nascente is a regenerative initiative that longs to reforest Portugal and Spain by proving that a forest can be ecologically sound while also being wildly productive. In the process, we believe that committed people and communities can benefit culturally and economically from the stewarding of degraded lands into forests that resist wildfire and flourish in the age of climate crisis.

#### Policy Plan 2019-2023
Our 5-year policy plan was agreed on by the board of Stichting Sol Nascente on the 3rd of Octobre, 2019. The policy plan will be adjusted at the beginning of every calendar year or whenever the board considers it necessary.

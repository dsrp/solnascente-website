Sol Nascente is a non-profit organisation that longs to regenerate and reforest the north of Portugal and Spain by proving that a forest can be ecologically sound as well as wildly productive.

### Mission
Our mission is to take degraded lands and to transform them into flourishing forest communities. To acquire lands weakened by generations of neglect, manage them with regenerative agroforestry to build soil and resist wildfire. And in the same space, nest several forest productions which we then process into goods with a high added value. Simultaneously yielding natural beauty, carbon credits, conservation of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the very forest models which tie them together.

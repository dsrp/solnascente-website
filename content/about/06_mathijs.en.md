Mathijs is the secretary and co-founder of Sol Nascente.  He has a background in IT, physics and philosophy. At heart, though, he is an explorer of complex systems and employs the hacker mentality to make sure that Sol Nascente finds its place in the world. Whether the challenge is bureaucratic, communal, or institutional, he is adept at taking abstract or strange concepts and finding practical implementations within the rules of the systems.

Diego is the president and co-founder of Stichting Sol Nascente. Through his experience as a forest gardener (Bosquenauta) and writer he's helping to present our vision to the world, and design forests which are safe and abundant for people, fauna and flora. He believes that in order to restore our relationship to the natural world we need to find balance between our civilized and wild sides while we base our dreams on ecologic reality.

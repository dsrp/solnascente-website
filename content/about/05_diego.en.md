Diego is the president and co-founder of Stichting Sol Nascente. Through his experience as a forest gardener and writer, he is helping not only to design the forests but present our vision to the world. He  believe that forests can be a safe place for fauna and flora, and also be abundant and care for us. He believes in order to restore our relationship to the natural world we need to find a healthy balance between our civilized and wild side, as well as base our dreams on ecologic reality.
